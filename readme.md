# MDX prezzo on animation stuff

written using the amazingly easy [MDX - deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck)

### Todo
0. learn how to use this MDX framework at least a little
1. create delayed-display component, and use it
2. learn stuff about animation
3. write it down here
4. internalise some of the crap from [here](https://github.com/manucorporat/perf-apis-2/tree/dcec287625cd4d6aca5e92ad2ad52b0f7fdb1989)
5. turn this into an exporter for future projects
